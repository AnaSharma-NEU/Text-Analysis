<h1>Text Analysis</h1> 

To identify which pupils may need to improve their motor abilities at an early age, a school
is attempting to determine whether they can utilize a writing exam. We are trying to understand
what the images are from that writing test and derive model accuracy for the correct prediction.
The data has been mentioned in the form of pixels and each pixel basically represents an image.

 It's important for survey creators to evaluate the feedback they have received, and text analysis may be used to evaluate open-ended replies. Organizations wishing to organise their unstructured data by identifying patterns in the text and transforming it into computer-readable formats will find text analysis tools to be helpful. Text may be transformed into useful information that can be used to assist corporate decision-making using text analysis tools for sentiment analysis, linguistic analysis, or quantitative text analysis.

We have used multiple algorithms for analysing the text: Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbour Approach, Random Forest Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting and Nueral Networks with Keras and Tensorflow Libraries.
